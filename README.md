notes of learning from https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs

## 概念

* Arguments:  
  values you give your program that affect how it runs.

* Machine code:  
  programming languages spoken by computer processors.

* ECMAScript:  
  the standard javascript is based on.

* A javascript engine:  
  a program that converts javascript code into something the computer processor can understand.

* Breakpoint:  
  a spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution of our code.

* Module:  
  a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.

* CommonJS modules:  
  an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

* First-class functions:  
  everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.

* An expression:  
  a block of code that results in a value.

* Name / value pair:  
  a name which maps to a value.

* Object:  
  a collection of name / value pairs.

* Object literal:
  name / value pairs separated by commas and surrounded by curly braces.

* Inheritance:  
  one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

* Function constructors:  
  a normal function that is used to construct objects.

* Primitive:  
  a type of data that represents a single value.

* Scope:  
  where in code you have access to particular variable of function.

* JSON:  
  "Javascript object notation" - a standard for structuring data that is inspired by javascript object literals.

* Revealing module pattern:  
  exposing only the properties and methods you want via an returned object.

* Web server:  
  1. Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces.
  2. Ways to deal with files.
  3. Ways to deal with databases.
  4. The ability to communicate over the internet.
  5. The ability to accept request and send response.
  6. A way to deal with work that takes a long time.

* Event:  
  something that has happened in our app that we can respond to.

* Event listener:  
  the code that responds to an event.

* Magic string:  
  a string that has some special meaning in our code.

* Template literal:  
  a way to concatenate strings in javascript (ES6).

* Syntactic sugar:  
  a feature that only changes how you type something, but nothing changes under the hood.

* Asynchronous:  
  more than one process running simultaneously.

* Synchronous:  
  one process execution at a time.
  javascript is synchronous, nodejs is asynchronous.

* Callback:  
  a function passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point.

* Non-blocking:  
  doing other things without stopping your programming from running.

* Buffer:  
  a temporary holding spot for data being moved from one place to another.

* Stream:  
  a sequence of data made available over time.

* Binary data:  
  data stored in binary (sets of 1s and 0s).

* Character set:  
  a representation of characters as numbers.

* Character encoding:  
  how characters are stored in in binary.

* Byte:  
  8 bits, 00101100.

* Error-first callback:  
  callbacks take an error object as their first parameter.

* Chunk:  
  a piece of data being sent through a stream.

* Abstract(Base) class:  
  a type of constructor you never work directly with, but inherit from.

* Pipe:  
  connecting two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.

* Method chaining:  
  a method returns an object so we can keep calling more methods.

* Protocol:  
  a set of rules two sides agree on to use when communicate.

* Port:  
  once a computer receives a packet, how it knows what program to send it to.

* HTTP:  
  a set of rules (and a format) for data being transferred on the web.

* MIME type:  
  a standard for specifying the type of data being sent.
